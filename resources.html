<li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">w3schools</a><br />
w3schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know in order
to author good web pages. This is of value because there are a lot of tutorials and examples of web languages, including HTML
,CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, Node. Anyone working on the web will find this site as a 
resource to look up the things I need as well as working through tutorials to learn new things.<br />

     Code Academy is a good resource for not only learning to code but practice it as well. 
     The site has many differnt programming languages to choose from like HTML, Python, React, Ruby, Javascript, etc. You can jump in 
     and pick a language to learn or you can choose a subject, like Web Development for example. The subject will give you 
     career path and a skill path and show you the skills you would need. Anyone getting into coding or web design
     will find great use in this as it offers so many new things to learn, but gives you the ability to try new things and practice them.  <br />

<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br />
     Stack Overflow is an open community for anyone the codes. You are able to ask public or private questions about any type of code and the coding community will help you out. It is a great resource for 
     beginners as thousands of questions have already been asked and answered and all you have to do is search for them. I think it is a great resource for developers at any level to participate in the community
     and help each other out.  <br />

<li><p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a><br />
   Khan Academy is a learning website that is more well known for math assistance. However, in addition to several math topics, it also has programming topics to learn as well. It has some beginner courses that consist
   of instructional videos and do it yourself practice and more advanced courses. You can learn many different things in HTML, CSS, Javascript like drawing and animation. Even when you don't have time to practice the code
   yourself, the videos are interesting and informative to watch.   <br />

<li><p><a href="http://try.github.io/">Try Github</a><br />
    Try Github is a place to check out resources for learning Git. It has the handbook, or cheatsheets, and interactive editors for learning by doing. It is great for anyone first learning about git and is also a great resource
    for a quick reference. It has saved me many gogle searches in the past when I could not remember a specific command.  <br />

<li><p><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a><br />
    YouTube is an amazing resource for web development. There are so many tutorial videos on so many different coding subjects. There are videos for broad subject and very specifc subjects. I myself have found it useful for finding 
    tutorial videos on things outside of actual programming language. I have used it to watch videos on using Visual Studio Code and Cmder among many other subjects. While there are no do it yourself practice sections, it is a good 
    place to look for help that you are unable to find elsewhere.   <br />
